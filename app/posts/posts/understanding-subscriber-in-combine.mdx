title: Understanding Subscriber in Combine by re-implementing Sink

When we first start learning Combine, the introductory example is often something like this:
```swift
var subscriptions = Set<AnyCancellable>()
let publisher = [1, 2, 3, 4].publisher

publisher
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { print("Received completion: \($0)") },
        receiveValue: { print("Received value: \($0)") }
    )
    .store(in: &subscriptions)
```

This prints the following to the console:
```
Received value: 1
Received value: 2
Received value: 3
Received value: 4
Received completion: finished
```

The `sink` method returns an instance of `AnyCancellable`, which wraps an internal instance of type `Sink`.

Both `Sink` and `Assign` are built-in subscribers provided by the Combine framework. According to Apple‚Äôs documentation, `Sink` is ‚Äúa simple subscriber that requests an unlimited number of values upon subscription.‚Äù
In this post, we'll re-implement `Sink` ourselves, calling it `MySink`, to better understand how `Subscriber` works under the hood.

## Step 1: Conform to Subscriber
Because `MySink` is a subscriber, it must conform to the `Subscriber` protocol:
```swift
final class MySink<Input, Failure>: Subscriber where Failure: Error {
    func receive(subscription: Subscription) {
        subscription.request(.unlimited)
    }
    
    func receive(_ input: Input) -> Subscribers.Demand {
        print("Received value: \(input)")
        return .none
    }
    
    func receive(completion: Subscribers.Completion<Failure>) {
        print("Completion: \(completion)")
    }
}
```

In the `receive(subscription:)` method, we request an unlimited number of values, as expected from the standard `Sink`. In `receive(_:)`, we return `none`, meaning we don‚Äôt change the demand. (Note: demand is additive in Combine.)

Let‚Äôs test it:
```swift
let publisher = [1, 2, 3, 4].publisher
let mySink1 = MySink<Int, Never>()
publisher.subscribe(mySink1)
```
Output
```
Received value: 1
Received value: 2
Received value: 3
Received value: 4
Received completion: finished
```
So far, so good!

## Step 2: Create a mySink Extension
Now let‚Äôs extend `Publisher` with a method that mimics `sink`:
```swift
extension Publisher {
    func mySink() -> AnyCancellable {
        let sink = MySink<Output, Failure>()
        subscribe(sink)
        return AnyCancellable(sink)
    }
}
```
But this won't compile. You'll get the following error:
```
Initializer ‚Äôinit(_:)‚Äô requires that ‚ÄòMySink<Self.Output, Self.Failure>‚Äô conform to ‚ÄòCancellable‚Äô
```
To fix that, let‚Äôs make `MySink` conform to `Cancellable`:
```swift
final class MySink<Input, Failure>: Subscriber, Cancellable where Failure: Error {
    func cancel() {}
}
```

Testing it again:
```
Received value: 1
Received value: 2
Received value: 3
Received value: 4
Received completion: finished
```
It works! But let‚Äôs take it a step further.

## Step 3: Support Cancellation Properly
Let‚Äôs try using a `PassthroughSubject` instead:
```swift
let subject = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()
let mySink2 = subject.mySink()
mySink2.store(in: &subscriptions)

subject.send("A")
subject.send("B")

// Cancel the subscription
mySink2.cancel()
subject.send("C")
```

Console output:
```
Received value: A
Received value: B
Received value: C
```
Something's wrong! We‚Äôre still receiving values after cancellation!

That‚Äôs because our `cancel()` method doesn‚Äôt inform the publisher that we want to stop. To fix this, we need to store the Subscription instance and cancel it properly:
```swift
final class MySink<Input, Failure>: Subscriber, Cancellable where Failure: Error {
    private var subscription: Subscription?

    func receive(subscription: Subscription) {
        self.subscription = subscription
        subscription.request(.unlimited)
    }

    func cancel() {
        subscription?.cancel()
        subscription = nil
    }

    // Other methods remain the same...
}
```

Now when we run the code:
```
Received value: A
Received value: B
```
Perfect.

## Step 4: Make MySink More Flexible
So far, we‚Äôre just printing values. But we want to allow custom behavior like the original sink. Let's update `MySink` to accept closures:
```swift
final class MySink<Input, Failure>: Subscriber, Cancellable where Failure: Error {
    private let receiveCompletion: (Subscribers.Completion<Failure>) -> Void
    private let receiveValue: (Input) -> Void
    private var subscription: Subscription?
    
    init(
        receiveCompletion: @escaping (Subscribers.Completion<Failure>) -> Void,
        receiveValue: @escaping (Input) -> Void
    ) {
        self.receiveValue = receiveValue
        self.receiveCompletion = receiveCompletion
    }
    
    func receive(subscription: Subscription) {
        self.subscription = subscription
        subscription.request(.unlimited)
    }

    func receive(_ input: Input) -> Subscribers.Demand {
        receiveValue(input)
        return .none
    }
    
    func receive(completion: Subscribers.Completion<Failure>) {
        receiveCompletion(completion)
        subscription = nil
    }

    func cancel() {
        subscription?.cancel()
        subscription = nil
    }
}
```

And don‚Äôt forget to update the `mySink` extension:
```swift
extension Publisher {
    func mySink(
        receiveCompletion: @escaping (Subscribers.Completion<Failure>) -> Void,
        receiveValue: @escaping (Output) -> Void
    ) -> AnyCancellable {
        let sink = MySink<Output, Failure>(
            receiveCompletion: receiveCompletion,
            receiveValue: receiveValue
        )
        subscribe(sink)
        return AnyCancellable(sink)
    }
}
```

## Wrapping Up
And that‚Äôs it! We‚Äôve re-implemented the core behavior of Combine‚Äôs `Sink` and `sink`. While the real implementation is more complex and handles more edge cases, our version captures the key ideas. Rebuilding components like this is a great way to deepen your understanding of Combine‚Äôs architecture.
