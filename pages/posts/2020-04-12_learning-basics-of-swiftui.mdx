# Learning basics of SwiftUI by writing a simple iOS app

Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI (and Combine).  Both new frameworks from Apple are amazing and pleasant to learn.

To practice what I've learned I made an iOS app-named The Airliners.  It provides brief information on the Boeing 7x7 series aircraft, with all data I get from Wikipedia.

import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/images/the-airliners-app-screens.png"
  alt="The Airliners app screenshot"
  width={1125}
  height={750}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>

For now, this app is quite simple. For the appearance side, it has only two screens. For the business logic side, it just applies some SwiftUI syntax like `@State`, `@Environment`, `@ObservedObject`, ... I plan to add more features as I'm learning.

The source code for the app can be found [here](https://github.com/Thieurom/the-airliners).
